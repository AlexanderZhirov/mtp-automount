# mtp-automount

Automatic mounting of MTP devices via systemd based on rules [M0Rf30/android-udev-rules](https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules).

This `/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.patch` is applicable to the commit file [d6d8091](https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules/blob/d6d8091aa2e865aedbc39049588ddf7d0f3f81be/51-android.rules).

The repository presents the directory structure and the presence of system files in it for processing the connected device.

I welcome improvements, if any.
